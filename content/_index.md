Hello, I am Antoine Vandecrème a programmer located in France.

You somehow landed on my personal website which I hope to fill with some blog posts.

This site is built with [Zola ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear](https://codeberg.org/alanpearce/zola-bearblog).
So, many thanks to [Alan Pearce](https://alanpearce.eu), the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) contributors
and the [bear blog](https://bearblog.dev/) creator [Herman](https://herman.bearblog.dev/).
